# Travebyl - Chornobyl travel agency
This is a website of a non-existent, Chornobyl travel agency called Travebyl. It was made by Albert Halusiak as a backend PHP and SQL programmer, and me - responsible for the frontend stuff, like HTML, CSS, and JS with bootstrap.

The website lets us log into an existing account or made a new one. Then we can reserve a trip one week in advance, for 1-4 people attached to the account's owner, who will get all the details about the trip in an email from the agency. We can decide if we want a group variant that's two days long, in which a group of people declared by user will be attached to other reservations creating a bigger trip, for ~20 people. Also, this variant is far stricter in the matter of places visited and sticking to the trip's schedule, in opposite to individual variant, which lets user’s group to explore the zone alone with our tour guide, straying a little bit off the beaten path, discovering the unknown…

There is also an optional checkbox during the tour reservation, which lets the user decide if they want help with acquiring insurance.

From the website’s functionalities, it is also worth mentioning the optional darkmode button.
